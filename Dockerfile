# Production image: builds the SPA and bundles it with the Django backend.
# On start the container copies /app/frontend_dist into the shared
# frontend_data volume for Caddy to serve directly (see
# docker-compose.prod.yml) — this image is the single versioned artifact for
# a release; Caddy itself does no building.
